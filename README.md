**Exploring and Enhancing the Linux USB Driver: Implementing Password-Protected Access and Data Encryption for Flash Drives
**
Cryptsetup is an open-source utility designed to facilitate disk encryption using the dm-crypt kernel module. It provides a user-friendly interface for setting up and managing encrypted block devices, making it a powerful tool for securing data on storage devices. Cryptsetup is most commonly used with LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup), a standard for disk encryption that simplifies management and supports multiple encryption keys.

In this project, Cryptsetup was utilized to secure USB flash drives by encrypting their contents and enabling password-based access. The tool ensures that all data stored on the device is encrypted transparently, protecting it from unauthorized access even if the device is lost or stolen. By leveraging Cryptsetup, robust encryption was implemented without requiring any modifications to the Linux USB driver.
